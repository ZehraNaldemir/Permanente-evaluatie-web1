  <h4>Who am I&quest;</h4>
  <p>I am Zehra Naldemir and my interest in fitness comes from my younger years. <br> At the age of 10 I started
    swimming&comma; I
    can say that after fitness it is one of my favorite sports. <br>
    When I was 16 I started playing volleyball. In
    between I also did badminton and dancing. I was very passionate about sports so my diary was almost full with only
    sports. <br>
    As I got older &comma; I wanted to start with fitness. <br>
    It all started with my first workout with a personal coach.
    I found it so inspiring that someone motivated me and helped me to work out and eat healthy food. <br> I thought
    about
    all the sports and nutrition schedules I got. For example&comma; I discovered that not only sport causes changes
    in the
    body&comma; but what you eat is also so important. That&apos;s when I understood the meaning of <i>&quot;You are
      what you eat.&quot;</i> <br>
    This is a quote from Nobel Coaching website:
    <blockquote cite="https://nobelcoaching.com/sports-benefits/"> Playing sports can have a positive impact on bone
      health as well. Engaging in a vigorous physical activity over a sustained period of time can improve bone mineral
      density, especially among girls. </blockquote>
    Once I got used to my new lifestyle eating healthy food&comma; I've unwittingly inspired other people as well.
    Trust me to become the best version of yourself. <br>
    <h4>My other hobbies besides sports</h4>
    <p> Besides sports&comma; I love music.
      I started playing the piano when I started swimming. <br> So I&apos;ve been doing it for as long as I&apos;ve been
      doing sports. <br> I also played bass in orchestras.
      I&apos;ve performed countless times in one of the oldest casinos in Beringen. <br>
      Besides playing the piano I also like to sing. Opera was really my thing&excl; <br>
      That&apos;s how I first started in choir at school and then at the music school. <br>
      And last but not least&comma; I&apos;ve been playing the stage for several years now. <br>
      I&apos;ve learned a lot. You&apos;d wonder how I combined everything and my answer to that is&colon; <br>
      if you can't make time&comma; you don&apos;t like it enough&#x00021;
