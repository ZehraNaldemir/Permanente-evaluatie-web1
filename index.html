      <p>Chris Maurice Brown&comma; better known as Chris Brown was born on May 5&comma; 1989 in Tappahannock Virginia.
        He is an
        American RnB singer. Besides singing he is also a very talented dancer. How many men do you know who can do two
        things at the same time? That is what I thought! Besides his perfect voice he is also known for his dance
        talent.
        He grew up listening to his mother&apos;s soul records. She mainly listened to Michael Jackson&comma;
        Sam Coocke&comma;

        Usher&comma;
        Stevie Wonder and Anita Baker.
        He himself preferred to go in the direction of rap. At the age of eleven he started singing himself. His father
        worked in a gas station&comma; where one day by chance a music producer came to gas and told him that he was
        looking
        for new talent. Then his father said he had a son with talent. That is how Chris Brown&apos;s career started.
        With the
        help of his producer Scott Storch his first single was released: <cite><a

      <p> Although he is known to many for his mistreatment with Rihanna&comma; he broke out with his talent several
        times
        after that. At the age of 15 he signed a contract with a record company. After that he played several movies
        like <cite><a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takers" target="_blank">Takers</a></cite>&comma;
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Christmas_(film)" target="_blank">This
            Christmas</a></cite>&comma;... Now he has two children.
        He named an album to his first daughter &quot;Royalty&quot;&comma; also he wrote a <cite><a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IajZTuxdv3Q">song</a></cite> starring her in
        the videoclip. She is such a cute baby&excl; Also not long ago he had a second child named &quot;Aeko&quot;. So
        he is also a good
        parent. I have been a fan of him since I was 16 years old. My 16th birthday present was a concert ticket for the
        One Hell of a night Tour.
        Since then&comma; my love for him has grown day by day. No matter what happens in his life&comma; I will
        continue to support him as a loyal fan! Last but not least I would like to dwell for a moment on the song
        Deuces. This song
        has a special value for me. This is also the song he wrote when he was in jail for the mistreatment of Rihanna.
        Of course you can guess that the lyrics has a lot of meaning. It is mainly about his feelings and rejection of
        both Rihanna and the media. The blame was not entirely Chris Brown&apos;s. Rihanna had triggered it a bit
        herself. How do I know this? Years later he talked about this for the first time in his documentary
        <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5588850/" target="_blank">Welcome to my life</a></cite>
        which is available on Netflix. It&apos;s a documentary about all the ups and downs in his life&comma; Chris&apos;
        whole
        life in a nutshell. I would strongly advise anyone to watch it who has negative recollections of Chris Brown
        because of
        Rihanna&apos;s negative influence on him in the media. </p>

      <p>His best-known albums include Indigo&comma; Fortune&comma; F.A.M.E&comma; X&comma; and my favorite Fan of a
        Fan. His albums include
        Tyga&comma; Lil Wayne&comma; Drake&comma; 50cent&comma;...
        His most famous songs are Run it&comma; Yo&comma; Forever&comma; With you&comma; Yeah and many more. My favorite
        song by Chris Brown is
        <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKCrSN9oXgQ" target="_blank">Ayo</a></cite> from the album Fan of
        a Fan&comma;
        <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKkb13IU_DE" target="_blank">Show me</a></cite> from
        Kid Ink his album <cite>My Own Lane</cite> and <cite><a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwkoXft0dXU&list=PLV6Zi5vmraQgZ_TvUVQD3VeegIDnoINOe&index=62&t=0s"
            target="_blank">Waves</a></cite>.
        The last one is not his own song but a remix-edit by Robin Schulz. Ayo sings along with
        Tyga&comma; I&apos;m less of a fan of him because he mainly raps while Chris Brown can also just vocal. Show me
        is a feature with Kid Ink&comma; he had a breakthrough in time with this song with Chris and after that he
        hasn&apos;t
        gotten that popular anymore. Chris Brown is a real legend. </p>
